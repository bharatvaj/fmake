fmake
=====

An attempt at saving developers time.

fmake is a program that brings `make`s interface to almost any build system.

See this |list.txt| for the number of build systems available.


fmake refrains from reading the source files, but does so when required like reading a version number or detecting a syntax.

Every build system has ranking that is followed so that 
autotools - 1
cmake - 1
make - 2 


fmake "intelligently" knows what targets to build
mapper files
------------

`fmake` has the analogy of mapper files which can be used to make a project.

USAGE
-----

To avoid complexity, fmake does not fork any process to run the commands. It just prints out the right command.

`make='$(fmake)'` This should be added in your .bash_profile, .zshrc for fmake to work.

When none is found, it just defaults to the `make` in $PATH
