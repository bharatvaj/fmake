A tool for the repo nomad.

fmake is a tool that brings `make`s interface to
almost any build system.

fmake "intelligently" knows what targets to build which can be
configured in the config.h file.

Opinionates build directory as 'out' in case of no clear build out
directory standard. Avoids in-source builds.

Usage
-----

Just type `fmake`, in your project directory to quickly run
fmake commands.

When none is found, it just defaults to running `make`.

Supported build files
---------------------
* *make
* bazel
* cmake
* configure
* gradle
* ninja
* nobuild

and much more! see the config.h for the complete list
