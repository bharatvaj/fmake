fmake
=====
An attempt at saving developers time.

fmake is a program that brings `make`s interface to almost any build system.

See below for the build systems currently supported

fmake refrains from reading the source files.

fmake "intelligently" knows what targets to build. These can be configured in the config.h file.

Opinionates build directory as 'out' in case of no clear build 'out' directory standard. Avoids in-source builds.

USAGE
-----

Just type fmake, in your project directory.

	alias m=fmake -a

to quickly run fmake commands.

When none is found, it just defaults to the `make` in $PATH

Supported build files
---------------------
* *make
* bazel
* cmake
* configure
* gradle
* ninja
* nobuild,
* and much more!

Find the complete list in config.h
