fmake is a tool that brings `make`s interface to almost any build system.

fmake offers a functionality similar to vim's makeprg, but does so in a
way that it can be used in various other programs and applications.

fmake "intelligently" knows what targets to build and can be
configured in the config.h file.

Usage
-----

fmake [options] [target] ...
Options:
  -?            Prints fmake usage
  -1|2|3        Force fmake to start from the level specified
  -C path       Change to directory before calling the programs
  -D            Print various types of debugging information.
  -N            Don't actually run any build commands; just print them.
  -V            Print the version number of make and exit.

Build Chains
------------
fmake automatically understands the following(and many more) sequences,
and tries to run it one after the other

    $ cmake -Bout .
    $ cmake --build out

    ----------(vs)----------

    $ fmake # You only have to type fmake!
    ++ cmake -Bout
    ...
    ++ cmake --build out
    ...

fmake can be forced to re-run the generator using `fmake -2`


Supported build files
---------------------
fmake queries filenames from `maker_config_t makers[]` defined in config.h.

Building fmake
--------------
*NIX,
        $ make
        $ make install

MSVC,
        * Open Developer Command Prompt *
        C:\fmake> nmake

Additionally 'type=release' can be passed to build as release.
Default is debug.

config.h
--------
config.h is a simple C header file, that contains a X macro which maps out the
file to look for and the build command that understands the matched file.

All entries have a level, which fmake utilizes to select a build methodology to
use when multiple types are found in the same folder.

An example would be GNU autotools,

   file            level
   configure.ac      3
   configure         2
   Makefile          1

    $ ls
    configure configure.ac src.c Makefile
    $ fmake

Here since the Makefile has the lowest level of 1, `make` is invoked.
If you decide to delete the Makefile, `sh configure` is invoked, as `configure`
is the next lowest level of value 2.

FAQ
---
> Why?
"People disagree on priorities and therefore, you can't create
the One & Only build system to end all other build systems."
                                                - jasode (a HN user)

fmake was born out of frustration with having to remember specific build
commands for different software projects.

> Why not use 'build/' instead of 'out/' as fallback default?
Using 'build/' for storing build artifacts is not preferrable for two reasons,
1. Some build systems use 'BUILD' as their manifest file, making it impossible
   to use 'build/' as output directory in case-insensitive file systems
2. More and more projects are using the 'build' directory for various repo
   specific tasks such as setting up CI or maintianing editor configurations.
