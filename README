fmake
=====
An attempt at saving developers time.

fmake is a program that brings `make`s interface to almost any build system.

See below for the build systems currently supported

fmake refrains from reading the source files.

fmake "intelligently" knows what targets to build. These can be configured in the config.h file.

USAGE
-----
To avoid complexity, fmake does not fork any process to run the commands. It just prints out the right command.

`alias make='$(fmake)'` should be added in your .bash_profile, or .zshrc for fmake to work.

When none is found, it just defaults to the `make` in $PATH

Supported build files
---------------------
* *make
* bazel
* cmake
* configure
* gradle
* ninja
* Much more to be added soon
