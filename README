fmake
=====

An attempt at saving developers time.

fmake is a program that brings `make`s interface to almost any build system.

See this |list.txt| for the number of build systems available.


fmake refrains from reading the source files, but does so when required like reading a version number or detecting a syntax.

Every build system has ranking that is followed so that 
autotools - 1
cmake - 1
make - 2 


fmake "intelligently" knows what targets to build
mapper files
------------

`fmake` has the analogy of mapper files which can be used to make a project.
