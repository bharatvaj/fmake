fmake uses chains.

CHAINS
------
Chains are created for build tools which require the user to execute multiple commands in order to execute the build.

Example
-------

	cd out
	ninja


This can be defined in the config.txt as,

FM_CMAKE->FM_NINJA

Another example is confiure
FM_AUTORECONF->FM_AUTOCONF
FM_AUTOCONF->FM_MAKE
